# Cyber Smart Security
## Artificial Intelligence for Network Intrusion Detection Systems

This repository contains the code used for my 2019-2020 science fair project.

This project compared various machine and deep learning models in detecting cyberattacks based on network packet data. The models tested were:
* Support Vector Machines
* K-Nearest Neighbors
* Decision Trees
* Random Forests
* Gradient Boosted Trees
* Multilayer Perceptron Network (aka Dense Neural Network)
* Convolutional Neural Network
* Recurrent Neural Network


The dataset used is CIC-IDS2017 from the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity, which can be found [here.](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html)

The [PowerPoint presentation](Scifair20%20Presentation.pptx) in this repo contains a detailed writeup on each part of the project.

The [Notebooks](Notebooks) folder contains Jupyter Notebooks with the code I wrote for the project.
